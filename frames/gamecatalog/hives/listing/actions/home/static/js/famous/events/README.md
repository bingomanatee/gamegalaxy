Events: Famous eventing libraries
-----------------------------------

Events are used for communication between objects in Famo.us.  Famous implements an event interface similar to that used in node.js.

# Files
- EventArbiter.js: A switch which wraps several event destinations and redirects received events to at most one of them.
- EventFilter.js: EventFilter regulates the broadcasting of events based on a specified condition.
- EventMapper.js: EventMapper routes events to various event destinations based on custom logic.
